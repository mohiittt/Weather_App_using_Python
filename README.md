Weather_App_using_Python

Here we have created a bsaic weather app using python to check minimum and maximum temperature of the day.

To start you off, we've found a free weather API, so all you need to do is customize your timezone, longitude and latitude. This code gets the max & min temperature and weather code.

Our weather app should:

1. Get the weather for your local area.
2. Output the forecast for today. It should show (in a really nice way):
3. The text version of what the weather code means.
4. Max & min temperatures.
